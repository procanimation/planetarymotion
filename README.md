# Planetary Motion
### Planetary motion animation based on keplar's law of orbital motion
Keplerâ€™s first law means that planets move around the Sun in elliptical orbits. An ellipse is a shape that resembles a flattened circle. How much the circle is flattened is expressed by its eccentricity. The eccentricity is a number between 0 and 1. It is zero for a perfect circle.
   ## Keplar's 3 laws of planetary motion 

  - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
  - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
